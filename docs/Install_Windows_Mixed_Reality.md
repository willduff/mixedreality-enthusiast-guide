# Install Windows Mixed Reality

## Launch Mixed Reality Portal

After you plug in your Windows Mixed Reality headset and the driver installs successfully, the Mixed Reality Portal (MRP) will automatically launch on your Desktop. If this does not happen automatically, you can always launch Mixed Reality portal from the Start menu (**Start > Mixed Reality Portal**). Once the portal has launched, click **Get Started**

## Compatibility check

Next up is the compatible check. MRP will check to confirm that your PC is compatible with mixed reality. **Green** checks mean your PC passed the required item! **Orange** triangles mean that there may be issues with your PC for the given requirement. If you encounter issues, you may need to troubleshoot or upgrade your PC. **Red** X's mean your PC does not meet the requirements for the specified item.
