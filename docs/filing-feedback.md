# Filing bugs and feedback

## Why it's important

The engineering team internally uses the same mechanism for finding and filing bugs. So use Feedback Hub and file issues; we are listening!

## How to file feedback for Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets on PC
1. Ensure you have the immersive headset connected to your PC.![Feedback Tab](images/feedback1.png)
2. Launch **Feedback Hub** on desktop with the HMD connected.![Add new feedback](images/feedback2.png)
3. Go to **Feedback Tab** on the left pane. ![Details and repro steps](images/feedback3.png)
4. Click **Add new feedback** button to enter the feedback.![Start Capture](images/feedback4.png)
5. Select **Problem** in **What kind of feedback is this?** to make the feedback actionable.![Submit](images/feedback5.png)
6. Provide meaningful feedback title in **Summarize your issue** box.![Thank You](images/feedback6.png)
7. Provide details and steps to reproduce the issue in the **Give us more detail** box.
8. Select **Mixed Reality** as the top category and then pick an applicable sub category:

   | Subcategory      | Description                                                                           |
   |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Apps             | Issues with a specific application.                                                   |
   | Developer        | Issues in authoring / running an app for Mixed Reality.                               |
   | Device           | Issues with the HMD itself.                                                           |
   | Home experience  | Issues with your VR environment: interactions with the Windows Mixed Reality Home.    |
   | Input            | Issues with input methods: motion controllers, speech, gamepad, or mouse and keyboard.|
   | Set up           | Anything that is preventing you from setting up the device.                           |
   | All other issues | Anything else.                                                                        |


9. To help us identify and fix the bug faster, capturing traces and video is extremely helpful. To start collecting traces, click on **Start capture**. This will begin collecting traces and a video capture of your mixed reality scenario.
10. Leave the Feedback app and run through the broken scenario. Do not close the Feedback Hub app at this point.
11. After you are done with your scenario, go back to the feedback app and click **Stop Capture**. Once you do that, you should see that a file containing the traces has been added.
12. Click **Submit**.

This will lead you to the "Thank You" page. At this point, your feedback has been successfully submitted. 

After you submit feedback, to easily direct other people (e.g. co-workers, Microsoft staff, [forum](https://forums.hololens.com/) readers, etc.) to the issue go to **Feedback > My Feedback**, click on the issue, and use the **Share** icon to get a shortened URL you can give to others to upvote, or escalate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before filing a bug, please ensure you meet the following constraints so that the logs are successfully uploaded with the feedback.
>  * Have a minimum of 3GB free disk space available on the main drive of the device.
>  * Ensure that a non-metered network is available in order to upload cabs.
