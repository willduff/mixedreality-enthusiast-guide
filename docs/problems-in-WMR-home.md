## Problems in Windows Mixed Reality Home

### My controllers aren't showing in my Windows Mixed Reality Home.

Make sure your controllers have full batteries and that they are paired correctly using Bluetooth. Try powering the controllers off and on using the Windows Button. If you still cannot see your controllers, try in-pairing and re-pairing each controller in the Settings menu under **Devices > Bluetooth**.

### The floor of my Windows Mixed Reality Home doesn't appear to be at the correct height, or it is slanted.

Select **Start > Room Adjustment** which will launch once you place the app in the world, to make changes while wearing your headset. In this app, you will be directed to use the touch pad (motion controller) or direction pad (gamepad) to adjust the floor height. When the floor feels correct, use the Windows button to exit back to your Home.

### My headset has stopped tracking.

Make sure the lights are on and that there isn't anything obstructing the inside-out tracking cameras on the front of your headset. If tracking is lost, it can take a few seconds to resume. If tracking does not resume, try restarting the Windows Mixed Reality Portal. See [Tracking Troubleshooting](troubleshooting-windows-mixed-reality.md#tracking-system) for more details.

### I can't show a preview of what I'm seeing in my headset on my desktop screen.

Mixed Reality Portal has a **Play** button at the bottom of the screen that allows you to show a preview of what you're seeing in your headset on your desktop's screen. But for performance reasons, this feature is only available on PCs running at Windows Mixed Reality Ultra (90Hz).
