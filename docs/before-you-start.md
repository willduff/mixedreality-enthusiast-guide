# Before you start

## What you'll need to run Windows Mixed Reality
* A Windows [Mixed Reality head mounted display (HMD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality-devices).
* A new [Windows Mixed Reality ready PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality-devices) or a Windows Mixed Reality compatible PC running Windows 10 Version 1709 or later.   
* Display, USB, and Bluetooth adapters (if required)
* Motion Controllers, an Xbox controller, or a mouse and keyboard
* Headphones with a mic (if your HMD doesn't have them built in)
* An internet connection
* A large, open space 

## Make sure your PC is compatible with Windows Mixed Reality
To see if your PC is Windows Mixed Reality compatible check the [Windows Mixed Reality minimum P hardware requirements](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md) or run the Windows Mixed Reality PC Check app

### How do I get the app?
**Download and run the app:** Launch the Windows Store from your Desktop, search for the **Mixed Reality PC Check App** and click Get to download and install it. You can also [follow this link](https://aka.ms/mrcheck) to launch the correct Store page. On Windows 10 PCs with at least Windows 10 Version 1607 (Anniversary Update), this application can check your hardware and software to determine whether the device can support Windows Mixed Reality in its current state.

**See if your PC is compatible with Windows Mixed Reality:** You should get results that look similar to the image below. If all checks are **green**, you're good to go! **Orange** triangles mean that your mixed reality experience may be sub-optimal. **Red** X's mean that your PC does not meet the minimum requirements to run Windows Mixed Reality.

## Make sure you have the Windows 10 Version 1709 or newer installed

You must be running the Windows 10 Version 1709 (the Fall Creators Update) or newer to use Windows Mixed Reality. Compatible versions of Windows 10 include:
* Windows 10 Version 1709 (Fall Creators Update, build 16299)
* Windows 10 Version 1803 (Spring Update, build 17134)

To see which version of Windows 10 your device is currently running, select the **Start** button, then select **Settings  > System > About**. 

To ensure that Windows 10 is up to date on your PC, select the **Start** button, then select **Settings > Update & security > Windows Update**.  Select **Check for updates**. If updates are available, install them.

## Make sure that you have any required adapters

Your Windows Mixed Reality compatible PC may not have the full-sized HDMI and USB 3.0 ports needed to connect your immersive headset. Or you may need a Bluetooth adapter to meet the PC Check requirements.  If that's the case, you'll need adapters to connect your headset and Motion Contollers. You'll find a list of adapter types you may need, and some recommendations on specific adapter models [here](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md).

## Make sure that you have input devices

Windows Mixed Reality is designed to work best with Windows Mixed Reality Motion Controllers, which provide natural, precise interactions with no need to install hardware on your walls.  But you can also use an Xbox controller or a mouse and keyboard. 

## Get headphones if your headset didn't come with them

Unless you purchased a Samsung HMD Odyssey headset (which has integrated AKG headphones and an integrated dual-array microphone), you will need to get an audio headset a pair of headphones that can plug into your HMD’s headset's 3.5mm audio jack.

## Make sure your PC is connected to the internet

Check that your PC is connected to the Internet. You will need to download drivers and some additional software to get Windows Mixed Reality up and running.  If your Wi-Fi network connection is set to metered, change it to unmetered. [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028458/windows-metered-connections-in-windows-10)

## Make sure that you have a large, open space

If you want to move around while using Windows Mixed Reality you'll need to have a large, open space.  During setup you will be asked to choose between "Seated and standing," or "All experiences" and you'll want to chose  "All experiences" and set up a boundary if you want to move around.   

### Seated and standing (no boundary)
If you select Seated and standing , you'll be using your headset without a boundary. This means you'll need to stay in one spot when using the headset, so that you can avoid physical obstacles and tripping hazards. You can sit down or stand up, but you shouldn't move around. Some apps might be designed to work with a boundary, so you might not be able to use them, or might not have the same experience, if you use them without a boundary.

### All experiences (boundary)
If you choose "All experiences," you'll set up a boundary, and you will be able to move around and use apps and experiences that work with a boundary as well as those that don't require one. You'll need to prepare your space to make sure there are no obstacles, hazards, or fragile items in the area you’ll be using (including above your head). Don’t set up at the top of a staircase or under an extra-low ceiling fan. Remove breakables and obstacles from the area, and make sure that you and anyone who uses your headset reads and understands the safety guidelines.
