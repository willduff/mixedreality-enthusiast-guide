# Using games and apps in Windows Mixed Reality

Windows Mixed Reality is just Windows. That means you can run immersive games designed for mixed reality, and you can run all of the regular 2D apps you know and love on your Desktop (like Candy Crush or Photoshop/AutoCAD).

## How to get into your first immersive game
1. Go to the Store slate that is placed in mixed reality
2. Search for HoloTour
3. Download it. You can walk around your mixed reality home and do other things
4. Open up the Start menu by pressing the Windows button on your controller (or Windows Key on your keyboard). Search for HoloTour. You may need to select All Apps
5. Click HoloTour in Start and place the slate
6. The experience will launch and take over the experience in your headset!

## How to place your first 2D app slate
1. Go to the Store slate that is placed in mixed reality
2. Search for your favorite 2D app (e.g. Candy Crush)
3. Download it. You can walk around your mixed reality home and do other things
4. Open up Start in Mixed Reality by pressing the Start on your controller (or Windows Key on your keyboard). Search for Candy Crush (you may need to press All Apps)
5. Click Candy Crush in Start and place the slate
6. You can now interact with the 2D slate using your controllers / mouse & keyboard / gamepad!

## How to use a full Desktop application
1. Open up Start in Mixed Reality by pressing the Start on your controller (or Windows Key on your keyboard). Search for Desktop Preview (you may need to press All Apps)
2. Click Desktop Preview in Start and place the slate
3. You can now see your Desktop!
4. Click the slate and use your mouse and keyboard to launch any full desktop application you desire (like Photoshop or AutoCAD)

## How to get into your first WebVR experience
1. Ensure that your headset is plugged in and controllers are powered on (if you have them)
2. Go to the Microsoft Edge slate that is placed in mixed reality, or Microsoft Edge application on the windows desktop
3. Navigate to a website that supports WebVR. Some Examples:
   * [A-Painter](https://aframe.io/a-painter/)
   * [A-Blast](https://aframe.io/a-blast/)
   * [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)
   * [CNN/VR](https://cnn.com/vr)
4. Click the 'Enter VR' button on the webpage. It may look similar to:\

5. The first time you try to enter VR on a specific domain, the browser will ask for consent to use immersive view. Click Yes: ![Consent UI that is displayed on the first attempt to Enter VR on a particular domain](images/1053px-Webvr-consent-ui.png)
6. The experience will launch and take over the experience in your headset!

**Note:** You can launch WebVR experiences from Microsoft Edge either from within Windows Mixed Reality, or on the Windows Desktop.

* Take off your headset and go to a different browser tab
* Some pages may offer a button on the 2D website to "Exit VR".

## How to get into your first SteamVR experience
