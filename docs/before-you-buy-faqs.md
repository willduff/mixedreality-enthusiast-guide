**140 character response:** Details about Windows Mixed Reality PCs and Ultra PCs are captured here: <https://aka.ms/mrcompat>

### What is the difference between Windows Mixed Reality and other VR headsets?

**140 character response:** Windows Mixed Reality headsets feature inside-out tracking (tracking cameras are in the headset) and plug-and-play setup with Windows 10.

**More detail**: Windows Mixed Reality offers several features, including easy setup (no need for external sensors to track you and your controllers), your choice of headsets to meet your comfort and price-point, headsets that have competitive resolutions, and finally a unique user experience that features a spatial interface which allows you to use thousands of apps from the Microsoft Store.

### Why is this called Windows "Mixed Reality" when the devices look like they provide a "Virtual Reality" experience?

**140 character response:** Because the Windows Mixed Reality platform supports the spectrum of spatial computing, from augmented reality and holograms to virtual reality. Learn more here

### Can inside-out tracking of motion controllers impact my game play due to camera FOV?

**140 character response:** We recommend you visit a Microsoft store near you to try out the headset and controllers for yourself and get a feel for it. This page will help you find a Microsoft Store location near you: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations>

### Technical Answer: Can inside-out tracking of motion controllers impact my game play due to camera FOV?

**Technical Answer:** Like the headsets, the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers require no setup of external tracking sensors. Instead, the controllers are tracked by sensors in the headset itself. If the user moves the controllers out of the headset's field of view, in most cases Windows will continue to infer controller positions and provide them to the app. When the controller has lost visual tracking for long enough, the controller's positions will drop to approximate-accuracy positions. At this point, the system will body-lock the controller to the user, tracking the user's position as they move around, while still exposing the controller's true orientation using its internal orientation sensors. Many apps that use controllers to point at and activate UI elements can operate normally while in approximate accuracy without the user even noticing. The best way to get a feel for this is to try it yourself. Try visiting a Microsoft store near you and check it out! In the meantime, here's a video with examples of immersive content that works with motion controllers across various tracking states:

### How is Windows Mixed Reality different from Samsung Gear VR?

All smartphone based VR products, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream, use 3 Degrees Of Freedom (3DOF) head position tracking systems. 3DOF based systems allow you to move your head **only** from the neck up in the virtual world. Windows MR on the other hand uses a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) head and controllers position tracking systems. 6DOF based systems allow you to move your entire body in the virtual world; so you can walk around an object and see it from different perspectives, just like you can in the physical world.

The Rift and the Vive are also 6DOF based systems.
